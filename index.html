The year was greatly affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, with numerous films originally scheduled for theatrical release were postponed or released on video on demand or streaming services. However, it is to be kept in mind that several film companies stopped reporting box-office numbers during this time due to the pandemic, and several films are still in theatres where guidelines enable so.[1] As a result, numbers will grow if they are re-released in the future to compensate for the impact this pandemic has had on consumers and film-watchers.

Although the advent of film as an artistic medium is not clearly defined, the commercial, public screening of ten of Lumière brothers' short films in Paris on 28 December 1895 can be regarded as the breakthrough of projected cinematographic motion pictures. There had been earlier cinematographic results and screenings by others like the Skladanowsky brothers, who used their self-made Bioscop to display the first moving picture show to a paying audience on 1 November 1895 in Berlin, but they lacked either the quality, financial backing, stamina or the luck to find the momentum that propelled the cinématographe Lumière into a worldwide success.

The first decade of motion picture saw film moving from a novelty to an established mass entertainment industry. The earliest films were in black and white, under a minute long, without recorded sound and consisted of a single shot from a steady camera.
Some ancient sightings of gods and spirits may have been conjured up by means of (concave) mirrors, camera obscura or unknown projectors. By the 16th century, necromantic ceremonies and the conjuring of ghostly apparitions by charlatan "magicians" and "witches" seemed commonplace.
The very first magic lantern shows seem to have continued this tradition with images of death, monsters and other scary figures.
